PhishingDetectionTool
An advanced tool for detecting phishing threats and enforcing security policies across domains, emails, and URLs.

Overview
The PhishingDetectionTool is designed to safeguard users and organizations against phishing attacks by leveraging heuristic analysis, real-time API integrations, and automated security policy enforcement. It evaluates domains, URLs, and email sources to calculate phishing probability scores and applies configurable security policies to mitigate risks.

Features
Phishing Detection:

Analyzes domains, emails, and URLs using APIs (Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal) and heuristic methods.
Calculates phishing probability scores for accurate risk assessment.
Security Policy Enforcement:

Applies password, firewall, and audit logging policies for Windows and Linux.
Fully customizable for General and Enterprise-level configurations.
Scalable and Configurable Architecture:

Easily adjustable thresholds, API keys, and resource paths via configuration files.
Designed for real-time analysis and high-performance use cases.
System Requirements
Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Java 8 or later.
Operating System: Supports Windows and Linux.
API Keys:
Google Safe Browsing API Key.
VirusTotal API Key.
Resource Files:
A file containing known malicious domains (malicious_domains.txt).
Installation
Prerequisites
Install Java 8 or later on your system.
Obtain API keys for:
Google Safe Browsing
VirusTotal.
Steps
Clone the repository or download the .jar file.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/PhishingDetectionTool.git
cd PhishingDetectionTool
Add your API keys to the application.properties file in the project’s resources folder.
Example:
properties
Copy code
google.api.key=YOUR_GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY
virustotal.api.key=YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY
Place the resource file (malicious_domains.txt) in the same directory as the .jar or update its path in application.properties.
Build the project using Maven (optional if .jar is provided):
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application using the following command:
bash
Copy code
java -jar PhishingDetectionTool.jar
Usage
Analyzing Domains, Emails, and URLs
Provide input for analysis (e.g., a domain, email, or URL).
The tool will calculate a phishing probability score and log the results.
Outputs include:
A phishing probability score (%).
Logs indicating detection results and applied security policies.
Example
Input: malicious-site.com
Output:

text
Copy code
Phishing probability for domain 'malicious-site.com': 85%
Security policy applied: Firewall updated to block malicious-site.com.
Configuration Options
Modify application.properties to configure:
API Keys: Add your API credentials.
Thresholds: Adjust phishing probability thresholds for classification.
Resource Paths: Specify paths to resource files like malicious_domains.txt.
Example:

properties
Copy code
google.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY
virustotal.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY
phishing.threshold=20
resource.path=resources/malicious_domains.txt
